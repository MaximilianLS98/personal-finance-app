# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Subscription Tracker feature enables users to manage and monitor their recurring subscriptions with intelligent detection from uploaded financial data. The system will automatically identify potential subscriptions from CSV transaction data based on recurring patterns, descriptions, and payment dates. Users can perform full CRUD operations on subscriptions and access a comprehensive dashboard that provides actionable insights about their subscription spending, including long-term financial impact projections and investment opportunity calculations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to automatically detect subscriptions from my uploaded CSV financial data, so that I don't have to manually enter all my recurring payments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a CSV file THEN the system SHALL analyze transaction descriptions and dates to identify potential recurring payments
2. WHEN the system detects transactions with similar descriptions occurring monthly THEN it SHALL flag them as potential subscriptions
3. WHEN potential subscriptions are identified THEN the system SHALL present them to the user for confirmation before creating subscription records
4. IF a transaction matches an existing subscription pattern THEN the system SHALL automatically flag it with isSubscription=true AND maintain its existing category assignment
5. WHEN analyzing transactions THEN the system SHALL consider variations in description text (e.g., "Netflix", "NETFLIX INC", "Netflix.com") as the same subscription
6. WHEN flagging transactions as subscriptions THEN the system SHALL preserve existing category classifications and allow subscriptions to belong to any category (entertainment, utilities, productivity, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, read, update, and delete subscription records, so that I can maintain accurate information about all my recurring payments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new subscription THEN the system SHALL require subscription name, amount, billing frequency, next payment date, and category assignment
2. WHEN a user views subscriptions THEN the system SHALL display all subscription details including cost per month, annual cost, payment history, and assigned category
3. WHEN a user updates a subscription THEN the system SHALL validate the new information and update all related calculations while maintaining category consistency
4. WHEN a user deletes a subscription THEN the system SHALL remove the subscription record while preserving historical transaction data and their category assignments
5. WHEN creating or updating subscriptions THEN the system SHALL support multiple billing frequencies (monthly, quarterly, annually, custom) and integration with existing category system
6. WHEN a subscription is created THEN the system SHALL allow users to set categories from existing category list, notes, and renewal reminders
7. WHEN managing subscriptions THEN the system SHALL use an isSubscription boolean flag to identify subscription transactions while preserving their original category classifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a comprehensive subscription dashboard, so that I can quickly understand my subscription spending patterns and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the subscription dashboard THEN the system SHALL display total monthly subscription costs
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show total annual subscription costs
3. WHEN on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display upcoming payment dates for the next 30 days
4. WHEN viewing subscriptions THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (entertainment, productivity, utilities, etc.)
5. WHEN displaying subscription data THEN the system SHALL show spending trends over time with visual charts
6. WHEN a user views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL highlight subscriptions that haven't been used recently (if usage data is available)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see long-term financial projections for my subscriptions, so that I can understand the true cost of my recurring payments over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a subscription THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the total cost over 1, 5, and 10 year periods
2. WHEN viewing subscription projections THEN the system SHALL show potential savings from cancelling specific subscriptions
3. WHEN calculating long-term costs THEN the system SHALL account for potential price increases based on historical data or user-defined inflation rates
4. WHEN displaying projections THEN the system SHALL present data in both tabular and visual chart formats
5. WHEN showing long-term costs THEN the system SHALL compare subscription costs to alternative investment scenarios

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see investment opportunity calculations, so that I can understand what I could gain by cancelling subscriptions and investing that money instead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a subscription for analysis THEN the system SHALL calculate potential investment returns if that money were invested instead
2. WHEN calculating investment projections THEN the system SHALL use configurable return rates (default 7% annual return)
3. WHEN showing investment scenarios THEN the system SHALL display projections for 1, 5, 10, and 20 year time horizons
4. WHEN presenting investment calculations THEN the system SHALL show both the subscription cost and potential investment value side by side
5. WHEN calculating investment returns THEN the system SHALL account for compound interest and regular monthly contributions
6. WHEN displaying investment projections THEN the system SHALL include disclaimers about market risks and that projections are estimates

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about upcoming subscription payments and renewal dates, so that I can make timely decisions about continuing or cancelling services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a subscription payment is due within 7 days THEN the system SHALL display a notification on the dashboard
2. WHEN a subscription is approaching its annual renewal THEN the system SHALL notify the user 30 days in advance
3. WHEN viewing notifications THEN the system SHALL allow users to mark subscriptions for review or cancellation
4. WHEN a subscription hasn't been used recently THEN the system SHALL suggest the user consider cancelling it
5. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by cost impact and renewal urgency

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track subscription usage and value, so that I can determine which subscriptions provide the best value for money.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds usage information to a subscription THEN the system SHALL calculate cost per use
2. WHEN viewing subscription value THEN the system SHALL display cost per use metrics where available
3. WHEN analyzing subscription value THEN the system SHALL allow users to rate subscriptions by perceived value
4. WHEN displaying subscription lists THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by value metrics (cost per use, user rating, frequency of use)
5. WHEN a subscription shows low usage THEN the system SHALL flag it as a potential candidate for cancellation
