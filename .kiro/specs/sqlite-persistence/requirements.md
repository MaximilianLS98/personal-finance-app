# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A database persistence layer for the CSV Finance Tracker that replaces the current in-memory storage with SQLite database storage. This feature enables permanent storage of uploaded financial transaction data, allowing users to build up a comprehensive financial history across multiple CSV uploads and application sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded transaction data to be permanently stored in a database, so that my financial data persists between application sessions and I don't lose my imported transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize a SQLite database if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN transaction data is processed from CSV uploads THEN the system SHALL store all transactions in the SQLite database
3. WHEN the user closes and reopens the application THEN the system SHALL load all previously stored transactions from the database
4. WHEN displaying financial summaries THEN the system SHALL calculate totals from all transactions stored in the database
5. IF database initialization fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and gracefully fallback to in-memory storage
6. WHEN storing transactions THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity and handle database connection errors appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload multiple CSV files over time without losing previous data, so that I can build up a comprehensive financial history from multiple bank statements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading a new CSV file THEN the system SHALL append new transactions to the existing database without overwriting previous data
2. WHEN processing new transactions THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent duplicate entries based on date, amount, and description
3. WHEN multiple CSV files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL maintain all transactions from all files in a single database
4. WHEN calculating financial summaries THEN the system SHALL include transactions from all uploaded CSV files
5. IF duplicate transactions are detected THEN the system SHALL skip them and inform the user about the number of duplicates found
6. WHEN storing new transactions THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and proper indexing for performance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the database operations to be fast and reliable, so that uploading CSV files and viewing financial summaries doesn't slow down my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying transaction data THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms for datasets up to 10,000 transactions
2. WHEN inserting new transactions THEN the system SHALL complete batch inserts efficiently using database transactions
3. WHEN the database grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain query performance through proper indexing
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling and proper resource management
5. IF database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and provide meaningful error messages
6. WHEN performing database migrations THEN the system SHALL handle schema changes safely without data loss

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database layer to be well-structured and maintainable, so that future enhancements and debugging are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing database operations THEN the system SHALL use a repository pattern to abstract database access
2. WHEN defining database schema THEN the system SHALL use proper data types, constraints, and indexes
3. WHEN handling database connections THEN the system SHALL implement proper connection lifecycle management
4. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL handle database file location and permissions correctly
6. WHEN writing database code THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests for all database operations
