# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Budget Management feature enables users to create, monitor, and optimize their spending budgets using intelligent analysis of historical transaction data. The system integrates with existing transaction categorization and subscription tracking to provide comprehensive budget management with smart suggestions, progress tracking, and variance analysis. Users can set up category-based budgets, monitor spending in real-time, and receive actionable insights to maintain financial discipline.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create budgets for different spending categories based on my historical data, so that I can control my spending and achieve my financial goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new budget THEN the system SHALL require category selection, budget amount, budget period (monthly/yearly), and optional description
2. WHEN creating a budget THEN the system SHALL suggest budget amounts based on historical spending averages for the selected category (3, 6, or 12-month averages)
3. WHEN a user selects a category THEN the system SHALL display historical spending data including minimum, maximum, average, and trending patterns
4. WHEN creating budgets THEN the system SHALL support both monthly and yearly budget periods with automatic conversion between them
5. WHEN a budget is created THEN the system SHALL automatically calculate budget allocations for subscription costs if the category contains subscription transactions
6. IF a user creates overlapping budget periods THEN the system SHALL warn about potential conflicts and allow user to confirm or modify dates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my current budget progress at a glance, so that I can quickly understand how I'm tracking against my spending goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the budget dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current period progress as percentage spent and amount remaining for each active budget
2. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators (green/yellow/red) based on spending velocity: on-track (<75%), at-risk (75-90%), over-budget (>90%)
3. WHEN displaying progress THEN the system SHALL calculate daily/weekly spending pace to project end-of-period performance
4. WHEN budgets include subscription costs THEN the system SHALL show allocated vs. unallocated spending separately
5. WHEN a user exceeds a budget THEN the system SHALL display the overage amount and percentage clearly
6. WHEN viewing dashboard THEN the system SHALL show total budgeted vs. actual spending across all categories for the current period

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between monthly and yearly budget views, so that I can understand my spending patterns over different time horizons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user toggles to yearly view THEN the system SHALL aggregate monthly budgets or display yearly budgets with monthly breakdowns
2. WHEN in yearly view THEN the system SHALL show seasonal spending patterns and year-over-year comparisons where data exists
3. WHEN switching views THEN the system SHALL maintain context for the selected budget categories and preserve filter settings
4. WHEN displaying yearly data THEN the system SHALL project full-year performance based on current spending rates
5. WHEN viewing yearly budgets THEN the system SHALL highlight months where budget targets were significantly exceeded or under-spent
6. IF insufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate data limitations and provide available insights

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive intelligent suggestions for budget amounts, so that I can set realistic and achievable financial goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing budget suggestions THEN the system SHALL analyze 3, 6, and 12-month spending averages for the selected category
2. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the system SHALL identify and exclude one-time expenses or unusual spending spikes from baseline calculations
3. WHEN suggesting budgets THEN the system SHALL provide conservative (10% below average), moderate (at average), and aggressive (20% below average) options
4. WHEN subscriptions exist in a category THEN the system SHALL separate fixed subscription costs from variable spending in suggestions
5. WHEN historical data shows trending patterns THEN the system SHALL incorporate growth/decline trends into suggestions
6. IF spending shows high variability THEN the system SHALL suggest buffer amounts and provide confidence intervals

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to analyze my budget performance over time, so that I can identify spending patterns and optimize my financial behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing budget analytics THEN the system SHALL display month-over-month variance analysis showing where spending consistently exceeds or falls below budgets
2. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL identify spending categories with highest volatility and provide insights about irregular expenses
3. WHEN displaying trends THEN the system SHALL correlate budget performance with external factors like subscription additions/cancellations
4. WHEN budget periods end THEN the system SHALL automatically roll over unused budget amounts or alert users about surplus handling options
5. WHEN multiple budget periods exist THEN the system SHALL provide year-over-year comparison analysis for performance trends
6. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL recommend budget adjustments based on historical performance patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set up budget alerts and notifications, so that I can stay informed about my spending without constantly checking the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating budgets THEN the system SHALL allow users to configure spending threshold alerts (e.g., 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
2. WHEN spending approaches thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide dashboard notifications and optional email alerts
3. WHEN projected spending indicates budget will be exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide early warning based on current spending velocity
4. WHEN monthly budgets reset THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of previous month's performance and current month's budget status
5. WHEN large transactions occur THEN the system SHALL alert if they significantly impact budget progress (>10% of budget in single transaction)
6. IF spending patterns change dramatically THEN the system SHALL suggest budget reviews and provide updated recommendations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple budget scenarios, so that I can plan for different financial situations or goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing budgets THEN the system SHALL support creating multiple budget scenarios (e.g., "Conservative", "Vacation Planning", "Emergency Mode")
2. WHEN switching scenarios THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which scenario is active and allow quick switching between them
3. WHEN comparing scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side analysis showing spending allocation differences
4. WHEN scenarios overlap time periods THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully and warn users about active scenario changes
5. WHEN creating scenarios THEN the system SHALL allow copying existing budgets as a starting point for modifications
6. WHEN scenarios are inactive THEN the system SHALL archive them but maintain data for future reference and comparison
