# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Piggybanks feature provides users with a goal-oriented savings system that allows them to create multiple savings "buckets" with specific targets and time horizons. This feature integrates with the existing budget and transaction tracking system to provide intelligent saving recommendations based on historical spending patterns and income data. Users can visualize their progress toward multiple savings goals and receive actionable insights on how to achieve them within their desired timeframes.
