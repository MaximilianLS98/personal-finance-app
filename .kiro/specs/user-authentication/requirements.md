# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive user authentication and authorization system for the finance tracker application using Better Auth (https://www.better-auth.com/). Better Auth provides a modern, type-safe authentication solution that will enable secure user registration, login, session management, and multi-tenant data isolation to ensure users can only access their own financial data. This is critical for data privacy and security in a personal finance application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password using Better Auth, so that I can securely store and access my personal financial data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN Better Auth SHALL display a form with email, password, and confirm password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN Better Auth SHALL create a new user account with encrypted password
3. WHEN a user submits an email that already exists THEN Better Auth SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user submits a weak password THEN Better Auth SHALL display password strength requirements
5. IF password and confirm password don't match THEN Better Auth SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials using Better Auth, so that I can access my personal financial dashboard and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page THEN Better Auth SHALL display email and password input fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN Better Auth SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to dashboard
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN Better Auth SHALL display an error message without revealing which field is incorrect
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN Better Auth SHALL create a secure session with proper token management
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN Better Auth SHALL redirect to login page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want my session to be managed securely by Better Auth, so that my account remains protected while providing a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN Better Auth SHALL create a secure session token with appropriate expiration
2. WHEN a user closes their browser THEN Better Auth SHALL maintain session for a reasonable duration
3. WHEN a user is inactive for extended period THEN Better Auth SHALL expire the session
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN Better Auth SHALL invalidate the session immediately
5. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without valid session THEN Better Auth SHALL redirect to login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access only my own financial data, so that my privacy is protected and I cannot see other users' information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any financial data endpoint THEN the system SHALL filter results by the authenticated user's ID
2. WHEN a user attempts to access another user's data directly THEN the system SHALL return unauthorized error
3. WHEN a user uploads transactions THEN the system SHALL associate them with the authenticated user only
4. WHEN a user creates budgets or subscriptions THEN the system SHALL link them to the authenticated user
5. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL include user ID filtering in all data access operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my account settings, so that I can update my profile information and change my password when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses account settings THEN the system SHALL display current profile information
2. WHEN a user updates their email THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness and update the account
3. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL require current password verification
4. WHEN a user updates profile information THEN the system SHALL save changes and display confirmation
5. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data after confirmation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database to properly isolate user data, so that the application can scale securely with multiple users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is updated THEN all existing tables SHALL include a user_id foreign key
2. WHEN new transactions are inserted THEN the system SHALL automatically include the authenticated user's ID
3. WHEN data migration occurs THEN existing data SHALL be preserved and associated with appropriate users
4. WHEN database indexes are created THEN they SHALL include user_id for optimal query performance
5. WHEN foreign key constraints are added THEN they SHALL maintain referential integrity across user boundaries

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Better Auth middleware integrated throughout the application, so that all routes are properly protected and user context is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN Better Auth middleware SHALL verify authentication before processing requests
2. WHEN protected pages are visited THEN Better Auth SHALL check authentication status
3. WHEN user context is needed THEN Better Auth SHALL provide authenticated user information to components
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN Better Auth SHALL handle errors gracefully with appropriate redirects
5. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN Better Auth SHALL make user data available to the application context
